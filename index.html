                    to work from pretty much anywhere.</p>

            <p class="subtag text-small">Online education isn’t for everyone. People who are most successful with online
                education tend to be self-motivated, skilled with scheduling their time, and capable of meeting
                deadlines. Advanced reading and writing skills are often required to excel in text-heavy online
                education courses.Online education offers flexibility for people who have work or family
                responsibilities outside of school. Often, students enrolled in online education programs are able to
                work at their own pace, accelerating their studies if desired. Online education programs may also charge
                less than traditional programs.</p>

            <p class="subtag text-small">When choosing an online education program, you’ll need to decide between
                synchronous courses and asynchronous courses. Students taking online education courses synchronously are
                required to log on to their courses at the same time as their professors and peers. Students taking
                online education courses asynchronously may log on to the course website whenever they choose and do not
                have to participate in discussions or lectures at the same time as their peers..</p>

            <p class="subtag text-small">Many institutions offer online courses with great flexibility. In some cases,
                lectures are pre-recorded and provided on-demand to students, while other places of study have live
                lectures held at multiple times in a given day or week. This freedom allows students to set their own
                schedules for completing coursework, meaning they can work and attend college simultaneously to obtain
                an associate degree.</p>
